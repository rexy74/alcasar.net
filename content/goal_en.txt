num_1=Goals
num_2=Authenticating and controlling connections
num_3=ALCASAR forbids access to non-authenticated users Plogin + password). It behaves like an access lock to all Internet services.
num_4=Control of connections permits for example to defne users and/or users groups authorized to connect. For each users and/or users groups it is possible to defne validity period of connection weekly time slot connections as well as maximum on-line time connection speed or maximum amount of data that can be downloaded. To manage users ALCASAR is based on an internal
database which can be combined to an external directory PLDAC or Active Directory ©).
num_5=Tracing and attributing while protecting privacy
num_6=ALCASAR allows people in charge of organization to meet access and use policies of Internet consultation networks requirements. In France it allows to respect legal obligations to trace and attribute connections.
num_7=These requirements consist of authenticating users of the consultation network when they decide to connect to the Internet and to produce for each of them traces of all actions carried out Psurfng downloading watching or listening of multimedia mail discussion blog secure connections etc.). ALCASAR produces these logs in fles that can be easily archived on external media in order to be exploited within the context of a judicial inquiry. Within the framework of the cyber-surveillance and to meet requirements of the CNIL PFrench ICO) the generation of these logs is associated to the following mechanisms in order to ensure non-repudiation and to guarantee privacy :
num_8=User authentication fows are encrypted. Users can change their password at any time. These passwords are stored encrypted in the internal database. Log fles can be encrypted. These precautions allow to prevent accusations from another user or administrator to have taken exploited or modifed these data ;
num_9=Direct consultation of Internet nominative activities is impossible. Indeed traces of connections are intentionally scattered in many fles whose domains are split Pauthentications for one thing and Internet activities for another). Imputation of connections is made possible after a work of aggregate on these fles Pthis work is reserved for judicial authorities). The graphical management interface of ALCASAR only shows connections statistics and no nominative data related to activities realized on the Internet;
num_10=ALCASAR takes into account the protection against people who forget to log out. It automatically logs out users whose consultation equipment doesn't respond anymore Psystem
shutdown network failure etc.). Furthermore a plug-in permits to automatically disconnect user when the Windows session closes.
num_11=Securing the consultation network
num_12=ALCASAR integrates a frewall and a web antivirus in order to protect network consultation equipment from direct external threats. Moreover a specifc module has been created in order to protect authenticated users from internal hacker's attempts trying to spoof their sessions. 
num_12Bis=Security updates of consultation equipment Pantivirus and patches) are possible and can be automated through declared URL which can be directly reached with no prior authentication (trusted sites).
num_13=The portal
num_14=The security of the portal has been worked out like a bastion in order to resist to diferent kinds of threat :
num_15=using and securing of a recent and minimalist operating system PMageia Linux) ;
num_16=protection of the portal against internal attacks Phardening and anti-bypass) ;
num_17=free softwares which constitute ALCASAR are known as hardened and secured ;
num_18=for accesses to the graphical management console : encryption of all frames authentication and accounting separation between backup functions users management functions and administration functions Pwith administration profles).
num_19=Users
num_20=To protect users Alcasar includes two flter mechanisms :
num_21=the first one forbids accesses to web sites that the content could be reprehensible. This mechanism is totally tunable Penable disable add or remove sites etc.) ;
num_22=the second one forbids other trafc than the WEB in order to activate only the require one (https ftp faw multimedia faw etc.).
num_23=These two optional mechanisms have been frstly developed for organisms welcoming young people.
